## About Ember Link

Ember Link is a powerful platform designed for real-time collaboration. It enables you to build collaborative applications with ease by managing users, synchronizing data, and communicating over WebSockets.

- **Client API**: The Client object is the main entry point for interacting with EmberLinkâ€™s real-time platform. It can create and manage channels, handle authentication, and manage multi-tenant setups.
- **Channel API**: A Channel represents a real-time communication channel where users can interact with one another, share data, and collaborate.
